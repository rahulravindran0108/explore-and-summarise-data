# Synopsis
Based on recorded storm data from 1950 through 2011, this document tries to provide some insight into the effects of severe weather on the public. These kinds of answers can be beneficial to plan responses to severe weather events and to prepare contingency plans.
We found that convection events (Lightning, Tornadoes, Thunderstorm Wind, Hail) are the most harmful to public health. We also found that Flood events (Flash Floods, River Floods) are the most damaging to property and crops.
